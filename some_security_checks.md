### **Comprehensive Jupyter Sandbox Test Suite**

#### **Prerequisites**
1.  Ensure your entire service is running via `sh start.sh` or `.\start.ps1`.
2.  Open **two separate browser tabs or windows**, both pointing to `test.html`. We will refer to them as **Session A** and **Session B**.
3.  In each session, get the Auth Token and click "New Session" to generate a unique UUID for each.

---

### **Phase 1: Basic Functionality & Statefulness**

**Objective**: Confirm the sandbox works as a stateful code interpreter.
**Instructions**: Run these code blocks sequentially in **Session A**.

#### **Test 1.1: Stateful Variable Test**
```python
# Step 1: Define a variable
my_variable = 100
print(f"Variable defined. Value: {my_variable}")
```
**Expected Output**: `Variable defined. Value: 100`

```python
# Step 2: Use the variable in a new execution
# This proves the session state is maintained.
result = my_variable * 5
print(f"‚úÖ Calculation successful. Result: {result}")
my_variable = result # Update the state for the next test
```
**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ Calculation successful. Result: 500`

#### **Test 1.2: Library & Plotting Test**```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Use the stateful variable from the previous step
x = np.linspace(0, my_variable / 50, 100)
y = np.cos(x)

plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Cosine Wave (from 0 to 10)')
plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.grid(True)
# The Chinese title should render correctly due to simhei.ttf
plt.suptitle('‚úÖ ÁªòÂõæÂäüËÉΩÊ≠£Â∏∏')
plt.show()
```
**Expected Output**: A PNG image of a cosine wave graph. This confirms `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and the image response (`result_base64`) are all working correctly.

---

### **Phase 2: Environment Reconnaissance & Privilege Check**

**Objective**: Verify that the user code is running as the unprivileged `sandbox` user and cannot alter its environment.
**Instructions**: Run these in **Session A**.

#### **Test 2.1: User Identity Check**
```python
import os

uid = os.getuid()
gid = os.getgid()
username = os.popen('whoami').read().strip()

print(f"User ID (UID): {uid}")
print(f"Group ID (GID): {gid}")
print(f"Username: {username}")

if uid != 0 and username == 'sandbox':
    print("\n‚úÖ SECURE: Code is running as the non-root 'sandbox' user.")
else:
    print("\nüö© VULNERABLE: Code is running as root!")
```
**Expected Output**: A non-zero UID/GID (e.g., 1000) and the username `sandbox`. This confirms the `user=sandbox` directive in `supervisord.conf` is effective.

#### **Test 2.2: Filesystem Permission Check**
```python
# Attempt to write to a root-owned directory
try:
    with open('/etc/malicious_file.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('hacked')
    print("üö© VULNERABLE: Wrote to /etc successfully!")
except PermissionError:
    print("‚úÖ SECURE: Permission denied when trying to write to /etc, as expected.")

# Attempt to write to a user-owned directory
try:
    with open('/sandbox/test_file.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('ok')
    print("‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL: Wrote to /sandbox successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"üö© UNEXPECTED ERROR: Could not write to /sandbox: {e}")
```
**Expected Output**: Permission denied for `/etc`, but successful write for `/sandbox`.

#### **Test 2.3: Firewall Tampering Check**
```python
import os

# The sandbox user should not have the NET_ADMIN capability to view or change iptables
result = os.popen('iptables -L').read()

if "command not found" in result or "Permission denied" in result:
    print("‚úÖ SECURE: Cannot access iptables as sandbox user. The jail is tamper-proof.")
elif "Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)" in result:
    print("üö© VULNERABLE: iptables is accessible and has a default ACCEPT policy!")
else:
    print("‚úÖ SECURE: iptables command failed as expected for a non-privileged user.")
    print(f"(Output was: {result.strip()})")
```
**Expected Output**: A permission denied error. This is a **critical** test proving that the `sandbox` user cannot alter the firewall rules set by the `root` user at startup.

---

### **Phase 3: Network Isolation Grand Test**

**Objective**: The ultimate test of your network security model. We will try to establish communication between two workers.
**Instructions**: This requires coordination between **Session A** and **Session B**.

#### **Test 3.1: In Session A - Become the Server**
**Copy and run this entire block in Session A.** It will start a web server and print its IP address.
```python
import socket
import threading
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

# --- Get my own IP address ---
hostname = socket.gethostname()
my_ip = socket.gethostbyname(hostname)

# --- Define a simple HTTP server ---
class SimpleServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b"Hello from another worker!")

def run_server(ip, port=8080):
    server_address = (ip, port)
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, SimpleServer)
    print(f"Server thread started, listening on http://{ip}:{port}")
    httpd.serve_forever()

# --- Run the server in a background thread so it doesn't block ---
# Note: The timeout mechanism will eventually kill this worker. This is a one-shot test.
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_server, args=(my_ip,))
server_thread.daemon = True
server_thread.start()

print("--- üì° SERVER IS RUNNING (in the background) ---")
print(f"My IP address is: {my_ip}")
print("\nüí° INSTRUCTIONS: Copy the IP address above and paste it into the code for Session B.")
```
**Expected Output**: The script will print the IP address of the container for Session A (e.g., `172.28.0.5`). **Copy this IP address.**

#### **Test 3.2: In Session B - Become the Attacker**
**In your Session B tab, paste the following code.** **Replace `'PASTE_WORKER_A_IP_HERE'`** with the IP you just copied from Session A's output.
```python
import requests

# ‚ùóÔ∏è IMPORTANT: Replace this with the IP you got from Session A
target_ip = 'PASTE_WORKER_A_IP_HERE' 
target_port = 8080
target_url = f"http://{target_ip}:{target_port}"

if 'PASTE' in target_ip:
    print("üõë ERROR: Please replace 'PASTE_WORKER_A_IP_HERE' with the actual IP address from Session A.")
else:
    print(f"Attempting to connect to another worker at {target_url}...")
    try:
        response = requests.get(target_url, timeout=5)
        print("\nüö© VULNERABLE: Communication between workers is possible!")
        print(f"Received response: '{response.text}'")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print("\n‚úÖ SECURE: Could not connect to the other worker, as expected.")
        print(f"The firewall successfully blocked the connection. Error: {e.__class__.__name__}")
```
**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ SECURE: Could not connect to the other worker... Error: ConnectionError` or `Timeout`. This proves that the `iptables` jail set up by each worker at startup is correctly blocking traffic from other workers.

---

### **Phase 4: Resource Abuse & System Stability Test**

**Objective**: Verify the "Áâ≤ÁïúÊ®°Âºè" (Cattle Model) recovery mechanism.
**Instructions**: Run this in a **new Session C**.

#### **Test 4.1: Triggering a Gateway Timeout**
```python
import time

# This execution time (20s) should be longer than your 
# Gateway's configured timeout (e.g., 15s).
print("Starting a long-running task that will time out...")
time.sleep(20)
print("If you see this message, the timeout mechanism failed!")
```
**Expected Result**:
1.  The code will run for about 15 seconds (or whatever your `MAX_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT` is).
2.  The connection will close, and the Session Log in `test.html` will show a **`504 Gateway Timeout` error**. The message should say something like "Your secure environment has been automatically recycled."
3.  **This is a success!** It proves the Gateway correctly identified the unresponsive worker and initiated the kill-and-replace procedure.

**Follow-up Test**: After seeing the 504 error, try to execute a simple command like `print("hello")` in the **same Session C**. It should now fail (likely with a 500 error) because the Gateway no longer has a worker mapped to that UUID. To continue testing, you must click **"New Session"**. This confirms the old session was properly destroyed.

### **Phase 5: Exhaustive External Network Isolation Test**

**Objective**: To rigorously verify that the `internal: true` Docker network configuration effectively blocks all forms of outbound traffic from the worker container.
**Instructions**: Run these code blocks in any active session.

#### **Test 5.1: DNS Resolution Test**
**Objective**: Check if the container can resolve public domain names. If this fails, almost all other domain-based tests will also fail, but it's a critical first step.
```python
import socket

domains_to_test = [
    "google.com",
    "github.com",
    "www.python.org"
]

print("--- Testing DNS Resolution ---")
all_secure = True
for domain in domains_to_test:
    try:
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(domain)
        print(f"üö© VULNERABLE: Resolved '{domain}' to {ip}")
        all_secure = False
    except socket.gaierror:
        print(f"‚úÖ SECURE: Failed to resolve '{domain}', as expected.")

if all_secure:
    print("\nConclusion: DNS resolution is properly blocked.")
else:
    print("\nConclusion: DNS resolution is possible, which is a major security leak.")
```**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ SECURE: Failed to resolve ...` for all domains. Docker's embedded DNS server, when serving a network marked as `internal`, should refuse to resolve external names.

---

#### **Test 5.2: HTTP/HTTPS Communication Test**
**Objective**: Test the most common outbound protocols. This covers both domain-based and direct IP-based attempts.
```python
import requests

targets = {
    "Google (by domain)": "https://www.google.com",
    "Cloudflare DNS (by IP)": "https://1.1.1.1",
    "Google DNS (HTTP, by IP)": "http://8.8.8.8"
}

print("\n--- Testing HTTP/HTTPS Outbound Connections ---")
all_secure = True
for name, url in targets.items():
    print(f"Testing connection to: {name} ({url})")
    try:
        requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        print(f"  -> üö© VULNERABLE: Connection to {name} was successful!")
        all_secure = False
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"  -> ‚úÖ SECURE: Connection failed as expected. Error: {e.__class__.__name__}")

if all_secure:
    print("\nConclusion: HTTP/HTTPS outbound traffic is properly blocked.")
else:
    print("\nConclusion: The sandbox can make outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests.")
```
**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ SECURE: Connection failed as expected` for all targets. The errors might be `ConnectionError` or `ConnectTimeout`.

---

#### **Test 5.3: ICMP "Ping" Test**
**Objective**: Test a lower-level network protocol (ICMP). This uses the system's `ping` command.
```python
import os
import subprocess

targets = {
    "Cloudflare DNS": "1.1.1.1",
    "Google DNS": "8.8.8.8",
}

print("\n--- Testing ICMP (Ping) Outbound Connections ---")
all_secure = True
# The ping command options: -c 2 (send 2 packets), -W 3 (wait 3 seconds for response)
for name, ip in targets.items():
    print(f"Pinging {name} ({ip})...")
    # Using subprocess.run to better capture output and status
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["ping", "-c", "2", "-W", "3", ip],
        stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
        stderr=subprocess.PIPE
    )
    
    # A successful ping has an exit code of 0.
    if result.returncode == 0:
        print(f"  -> üö© VULNERABLE: Ping to {name} was successful!")
        print(result.stdout.decode())
        all_secure = False
    else:
        print(f"  -> ‚úÖ SECURE: Ping failed as expected.")
        # Optional: print stderr for debugging
        # print(result.stderr.decode())

if all_secure:
    print("\nConclusion: ICMP outbound traffic is properly blocked.")
else:
    print("\nConclusion: The sandbox can send ICMP packets to the internet.")
```
**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ SECURE: Ping failed as expected` for all targets. The `ping` command will exit with a non-zero status code, often indicating "Network is unreachable".

---

#### **Test 5.4: Raw TCP Socket Test (Other Protocols)**
**Objective**: This is a generic test to see if we can establish a TCP connection to common ports used for other protocols (like SMTP, SSH, etc.), bypassing HTTP libraries.
```python
import socket

# Targets are tuples of (IP, port, service name)
targets = [
    ("172.217.168.100", 80, "Google HTTP"), # An IP for google.com
    ("1.1.1.1", 53, "Cloudflare DNS"),
    ("173.194.222.108", 25, "Gmail SMTP"),
]

print("\n--- Testing Raw TCP Socket Outbound Connections ---")
all_secure = True
for ip, port, name in targets:
    print(f"Attempting TCP connection to {name} at {ip}:{port}...")
    try:
        # Create a new socket for each attempt
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
            s.settimeout(3.0)  # Set a timeout for the connection attempt
            s.connect((ip, port))
            # If connect() succeeds, the connection was made
            print(f"  -> üö© VULNERABLE: TCP connection to {name} was successful!")
            all_secure = False
    except (socket.timeout, socket.error) as e:
        print(f"  -> ‚úÖ SECURE: TCP connection failed as expected. Error: {e.__class__.__name__}")

if all_secure:
    print("\nConclusion: Arbitrary outbound TCP connections are properly blocked.")
else:
    print("\nConclusion: The sandbox can establish raw TCP connections to the internet.")

```
**Expected Output**: `‚úÖ SECURE: TCP connection failed as expected` for all targets. The error will likely be `timeout` because the packets are dropped by the Docker network firewall, and no "connection refused" response is ever received.
